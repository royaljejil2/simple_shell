Simple Shell

Introduction

Welcome to the Simple Shell project! This is a basic implementation of a Unix-like shell written in C. A shell is a command-line interface that allows users to interact with an operating system by executing commands. In this README, we will provide you with information on how to use and understand this simple shell.

Features

Our Simple Shell supports the following basic features:

Running Commands: You can execute simple commands such as ls, pwd, echo, and more, just like in a standard Unix shell.
Command-Line Arguments: The shell handles basic command-line arguments as expected.
Piping Commands: You can chain commands together using the | operator. For example, you can pipe the output of one command as input to another.
Input and Output Redirection: The shell supports input and output redirection using the < and > operators, allowing you to read input from a file and write output to a file.
Background Execution: You can run a command in the background by appending & to the command. This returns control to the shell immediately.
Built-in Commands: The shell provides a few built-in commands, such as cd for changing the current directory and exit for exiting the shell.
Getting Started

To use the Simple Shell, follow these steps:

Clone the Repository: Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/simple-shell.git
Navigate to the Project Directory: Move into the project directory:
bash
Copy code
cd simple-shell
Compile the Shell: Compile the shell using a C compiler like gcc:
bash
Copy code
gcc -o shell shell.c
Run the Shell: Execute the shell:
bash
Copy code
./shell
You should now be in the Simple Shell environment, ready to enter commands.

Usage

Running Commands
To run a command, simply type it and press Enter. For example:

bash
Copy code
ls -l
Piping Commands
You can pipe commands together using the | operator. For example:

bash
Copy code
ls -l | grep myfile
Input and Output Redirection
Redirect input and output using the < and > operators. For example:

bash
Copy code
cat < input.txt > output.txt
Background Execution
To run a command in the background, use the & symbol. For example:

bash
Copy code
sleep 10 &
Built-in Commands
The shell supports built-in commands:

cd: Change the current directory.
exit: Exit the shell.
Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues while using the Simple Shell, consider the following:

Ensure successful compilation with gcc.
Check for syntax errors in your commands.
Use the correct operators for piping and redirection.
